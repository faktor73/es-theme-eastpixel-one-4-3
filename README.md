# EASTPIXEL ONE (4:3)
### An EmulationStation/RetroPie theme in aspect ration 4:3

## About

This is a theme to use with EmulationStation 2.x in the combination with RetroPie.

I created this theme to match the brand of my game development studio EASTPIXEL for use on arcade machines (at trade shows, presentations, conventions).

If you like the style, feel free to use or customise it.

Please note: The theme was primarily developed for use with 4:3 screens.

## The theme contains a total of 105 logos of gaming platforms and game types
